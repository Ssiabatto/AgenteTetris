## [1.0.0] - 2024-11-04
### Added
- Initial project code: `src/tetris/`, `src/video/`, `src/matrix/`, and `src/AIBot/`.
- Main runners: `main.py` (live capture and processing) and `__main_.py` (offline move scoring debug helper).

### Notes
- This is the first functional version delivered: core capture, board-to-matrix conversion, and heuristic state scoring are implemented and working in a basic form.
- Core heuristics and helper functions are implemented in `src/tetris/tetris.py` and `src/tetris/pieza.py`.
